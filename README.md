## Election Audit Summary
  
   In order to complete the Analysis for this Election, I wrote the script on Python using Visual Studio Code, I was able to use the CSV file that was provide with all the data to be analyze, in the process I learned how to run the script and modify any error that was comming for each time that the code didnt run correctly, in the process I have to set my variables, as well as write the correct statement to calculate the correct information. I use if as need it and so many others ways to write the statements. I have a lot struggle trying to write on txt file but they were little mistakes that I have to correct one by one as they weren't working properly
